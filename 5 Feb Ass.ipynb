    "Answer:\n",
    "Class: Think of it as a blueprint or a plan for something. For instance, if you want to build a house, the architectural drawings that specify how the house should be constructed are like a class.\n",
    "Object: Now, an object is like the actual house that you build based on the architectural drawings (the class). Each house you build will have the same basic structure (defined by the class) but can have its own unique features, like interior decoration and furniture.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Imagine we have a class called \"Car\" that describes what a car is and can do:"

    "Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: It's like putting your data (information) and the actions (tasks) that can be done with that data inside a box. You can control who can access and change what's inside the box, keeping your data safe and organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: Imagine you have a toy, and you want to make a similar toy with some extra features. Instead of starting from scratch, you can use the first toy as a base and add the new features. Inheritance is like getting characteristics from a parent or a blueprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: Think of it as the ability of different things to act in their own unique ways while still being part of the same group. For example, animals can make sounds, but each animal makes a different sound. Polymorphism is like this flexibility in behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction: Abstraction is like looking at a car and knowing that it has a steering wheel, pedals, and buttons, without needing to understand every detail of how the engine works. It's about simplifying complex things so that you can work with them easily.\n"

    "Here's a simple explanation with an example:\n",
    "Imagine you have a blueprint for making cars (a class called Car). Each car you make should have certain characteristics like its color, make, and model. The __init__() function helps you set these characteristics when you create a new car (an instance of the Car class)."
